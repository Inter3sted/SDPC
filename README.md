Simple prompt combiner for Stable Diffusion, combines positive prompts of PNGs from metadata. Heavily inspired from [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92qe_wguYQI&ab_channel=SaintRadon)
> Ignores any PNGs metadata (if it can read it at all) from all sources except for Stable Diffusion
> Removes duplicate prompts

Use [this website](https://www.dcode.fr/png-chunks) to check the PNG chunks beforehand, if you'd like. 
For further research on PNG chunks: [Chunks](https://www.w3.org/TR/PNG-Chunks.html)
