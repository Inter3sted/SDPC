# SDPC

Simple prompt combiner for Stable Diffusion, combines positive prompts of PNGs from metadata. Heavily inspired from [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92qe_wguYQI&ab_channel=SaintRadon)
> ignores any PNGs metadata (if it can read it at all) from all sources except for Stable Diffusion

Use [this website](https://www.dcode.fr/png-chunks) to check the PNG chunks beforehand, if you'd like. 

All you have to do is:
1. create a folder
2. open the .py in VSCode or whatever code editor you want
3. Change the "your directory path" to your directory path.
